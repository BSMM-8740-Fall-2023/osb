## Introduction

This lab will go through much of the same workflow we've demonstrated in class. The main goal is to reinforce our understanding of R and RStudio, which we will be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions. An additional goal is to reinforce git and GitHub, the collaboration and version control system that we will be using throughout the course.

::: callout-note
Git is a version control system (like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).
:::

As the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R and the tidyverse. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.

### Learning goals

By the end of the lab, you will...

-   Have practiced version control using GitHub
-   Be familiar with the workflow using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub

## Let's Git Started

### 1. Register a Github account

Register an account with GitHub. It's free!

-   <https://github.com>

#### Username advice

-   Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they're dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.
-   Shorter is better than longer.
-   Make it timeless. Don't highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence, e.g. JennyFromTheBlock.

You can change your username later, but better to get this right the first time.

-   <https://help.github.com/articles/changing-your-github-username/>

-   <https://help.github.com/articles/what-happens-when-i-change-my-username/>

### 2. Git already installed?

Go to the terminal tab in RStudio and enter `which git` to request the path to your Git executable:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
which git
```

and `git --version` to see its version:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
git --version
```

### 3. Introduce yourself to Git

You can set your Git user name and email from within R:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
usethis::use_git_config(
  # user.name does not have to be your GitHub user name
  user.name = "Jane Doe"
  # user.email MUST be the email associated with your GitHub account.
  , user.email = "jane@example.org"
)
```

::: callout-note
Your commits will be labelled with this user name, so make it informative to potential collaborators and future you.
:::

### 4. Set up personal access tokens for HTTPS

The password that you use to login to GitHub's website is NOT an acceptable credential when talking to GitHub as a Git server. You can learn more in their blog post [Token authentication requirements for Git operations](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/).

The recommendation to use a personal access token (PAT) is exactly what we cover here. First you need to create your PAT, and you can do this from R:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
usethis::create_github_token()
```

The `usethis` approach takes you to a pre-filled form with pre-selected some recommended scopes, which you can look over and adjust before clicking "Generate token".

It is a very good idea to describe the token's purpose in the *Note* field, because one day you might have multiple PATs. We recommend naming each token after its use case, such as the computer or project you are using it for, e.g. "personal-macbook-air" or "vm-for-project-xyz". In the future, you will find yourself staring at this list of tokens, because inevitably you'll need to re-generate or delete one of them. Make it easy to figure out which token you've come here to fiddle with.

##### **4.1 Click "Generate token"**.

You won't be able to see this token again, so don't close or navigate away from this browser window until you store the PAT. Copy the PAT to the clipboard or a text file in RStudio.

Treat this PAT like a password! Do not ever hard-wire your PAT into your code! A PAT should always be retrieved implicitly, for example, from the Git credential store, a safe place, where command line Git, RStudio, and R packages can discover it.

##### 4.2 Save your PAT

-   Copy the generated PAT to a secure, long-term system for storing secrets, like 1Password or LastPass.
-   email it to yourself
-   ??

##### 4.3 Store your PAT in the Git credential store

Finally, we store the PAT in a safe place where command line Git, RStudio, and R packages can discover it. To do this call `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`. If you don't have a PAT stored already, it will prompt you to enter your PAT. Paste!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

Instead of saving your PAT you could just [re-generate the PAT each lab session and re-store it](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat#regenerate-pat). If you accept the default 30-day expiration period, this is a workflow you'll be using often anyway.

On github.com, assuming you're signed in, you can manage your personal access tokens from <https://github.com/settings/tokens>, also reachable via *Settings \> Developer settings \> Personal access tokens*.

### 5. How Git works

Git has three storages locally: a Working directory, Staging Area, and a Local repository.

𝟭. 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 - is where you work, and your files live ("untracked"). GIT is not aware of these files.

𝟮. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝗿𝗲𝗮 - When you stage your changes, GIT will start tracking and saving your changes with files. These changes are stored in the .git directory.

𝟯. 𝗟𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 - is the area where everything is saved (commits) in the .git directory. So, when you want to move your files from Staging Area to Local Repository, you can use the git commit command. After this, your Staging area will be empty. If you want to see what is in the Local repository, try git log.

The workflow looks like this:

![Git workflow](/images/git_workflow.jpeg){width="374"}

You are now ready interact with GitHub via RStudio!

### Clone the repo & start new RStudio project

-   Go to the course organization at [BSMM-8740-Fall-2023](https://github.com/BSMM-8740-Fall-2023/osb "Course GitHub organization") on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-1**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.

-   Click on the green **CODE** button, select **Use HTTPS** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with HTTPS**). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

-   In RStudio, go to *File* ➛ *New Project* ➛*Version Control* ➛ *Git*.

-   Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. Again, please make sure to have *SSH* highlighted under *Clone* when you copy the address.

-   Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the *Files* pane in RStudio.

-   Click *lab-1-ikea.qmd* to open the template R Markdown file. This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.

### R and R Studio

Below are the components of the RStudio IDE.

![](images/lab-1/rstudio.png){fig-alt="RStudio IDE"}

Below are the components of a Quarto (.qmd) file.

![](images/lab-1/quarto.png){fig-alt="Quarto document"}

### YAML

The top portion of your R Markdown file (between the three dashed lines) is called **YAML**. It stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.

::: callout-important
Open the Quarto (\``` .qmd` ``) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and render the document. Examine the rendered document.
:::

### Committing changes

Now, go to the Git pane in your RStudio instance. This will be in the top right hand corner in a separate tab.

If you have made changes to your Rmd file, you should see it listed here. Click on it to select it in this list and then click on **Diff**. This shows you the *diff*erence between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes. You should see deletions in red and additions in green.

If you're happy with these changes, we'll prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository. First, **stage** your changes by checking the appropriate box on the files you want to prepare. Next, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, "updated author name") in the **Commit message** box. Finally, click **Commit**. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.

You don't have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are *meaningful to you* for inspection, comparison, or restoration.

In the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.

Now let's make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub and you're good to go!

### Push changes

Now that you have made an update and committed this change, it's time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.

In order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have **staged** your **commit** to be pushed. click on **Push**.

## Packages

We will use the following package in today's lab.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

The tidyverse is a meta-package. When you load it you get eight packages loaded for you:

-   **ggplot2**: for data visualization
-   **dplyr**: for data wrangling
-   **tidyr**: for data tidying and rectangling
-   **readr**: for reading and writing data
-   **tibble**: for modern, tidy data frames
-   **stringr**: for string manipulation
-   **forcats**: for dealing with factors
-   **purrr**: for iteration with functional programming

The message that's printed when you load the package tells you which versions of these packages are loaded as well as any conflicts they may have introduced, e.g., the `filter()` function from dplyr has now masked (overwritten) the `filter()` function available in base R (and that's ok, we'll use `dplyr::filter()` anyway).

We'll be using functionality from all of these packages throughout the semester, though we'll always load them all at once with `library(tidyverse)`. You can find out more about the tidyverse and each of the packages that make it up [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

## Data: Ikea furniture

Today's data is all about [Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/) furniture. The data was obtained from the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-11-03/readme.md) data collection.

Use the code below to read in the data.

```{r}
#| message: false

ikea <- read_csv("data/ikea.csv")
```

### Data dictionary

The variable definitions are found in the help for Teams

```{r}
?Teams
```

### View the data

Before doing any analysis, you may want to get quick view of the data. This is useful when you've imported data to see if your data imported correctly. We can use the `view()` function to see the entire data set in RStudio. Type the code below in the **Console** to view the entire dataset.

```{r}
library(Lahman)
dim(Teams)
```

## Exercises

Write all code and narrative in your R Markdown file. Write all narrative in complete sentences. Throughout the assignment, you should periodically **Render** your Quarto document to produce the updated PDF, **commit** the changes in the Git pane, and **push** the updated files to GitHub.

::: callout-tip
Make sure we can read all or your code in your PDF document. This means you will need to break up long lines of code. One way to help avoid long lines of code is is start a new line after every pipe (`%>%`) and plus sign (`+`).
:::

### Exercise 1

The `view()` function helped us get a quick view of the dataset, but let's get more detail about its structure. Viewing a summary of the data is a useful starting point for data analysis, especially if the dataset has a large number of observations (rows) or variables (columns). Run the code below to use the `dplyr::glimpse()` function to see a summary of the `ikea` dataset.

How many observations are in the `ikea` dataset? How many variables?

```{r}
#| results: false

dplyr::glimpse(Teams)
```

::: callout-note
In your `lab-1.qmd` document you'll see that we already added the code required for the exercise as well as a sentence where you can fill in the blanks to report the answer. Use this format for the remaining exercises.

Also note that the code chunk as a label: `glimpse-data`. It's not required, but good practice and highly encouraged to label your code chunks in this way.
:::

### Exercise 2

[Ben Baumer](#0) worked for the [New York Mets](#0) from 2004 to 2012. What was the team W/L record during those years? Use `filter()` and `select()` to quickly identify only those pieces of information that we care about.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mets <- Teams  %>% 
  dplyr::filter(teamID == "NYN")
my_mets <- mets %>% 
  dplyr::filter(_)
my_mets %>% 
  dplyr::select(_,_,_,_)
```

### Exercise 3

We've answered the simple question of how the Mets performed during the time that Ben was there, but since we are data scientists, we are interested in deeper questions. For example, some of these seasons were subpar---the Mets had more losses than wins. Did the team just get unlucky in those seasons? Or did they actually play as badly as their record indicates?

In order to answer this question, we need a model for expected winning percentage. It turns out that one of the most widely used contributions to the field of baseball analytics (courtesy of [Bill James](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Bill%20James)) is exactly that. This model translates the number of runs^[4](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/04-dataI.html?s=03#fn4)^ that a team scores and allows over the course of an entire season into an expectation for how many games they should have won. The simplest version of this model is this:

$$
\hat{\text{W}}_{\text{pct}}=\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{\text{RA}}{\text{RS}}\right)^{2}}
$$

where $\text{RA}$ is the number of runs the team allows to be scored, $\text{RS}$ is the number of runs that the team scores, and $\hat{\text{W}}_{\text{pct}}$ is the team's expected winning percentage. Luckily for us, the runs scored and allowed are present in the `Teams` table, so let's grab them and save them in a new data frame.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mets_ben <- Teams |>
  select(_, _, _, _, _, _) |>
  filter(_ == "NYN" & _ %in% 2004:2012)
mets_ben
```

First, note that the runs-scored variable is called `R` in the `Teams` table, but to stick with our notation we want to rename it `RS`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mets_ben <- mets_ben |>
  rename(_ = _)    # new name = old name
mets_ben
```

::: render-commit-push
This is a good place to fender, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-1 repo on GitHub. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you've made, write an informative commit message (e.g., "Completed exercises 1 - 3"), and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.
:::

### Exercise 4

Next, we need to compute the team's actual winning percentage in each of these seasons. Thus, we need to add a new column to our data frame, and we do this with the `mutate()` command.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mets_ben <- mets_ben |>
  mutate(WPct = _)
mets_ben
```

The expected number of wins is then equal to the product of the expected winning percentage times the number of games.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mets_ben <- mets_ben |>
  mutate(W_hat = _)
mets_ben
```

### Exercise 5

In this case, the Mets' fortunes were better than expected in three of these seasons, and worse than expected in the other six.

In how many seasons were the Mets better than expected? How many were they worse than expected?

::: render-commit-push
This is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-1 repo on GitHub. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you've made, write an informative commit message (e.g., "Completed exercises 4 and 5"), and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.
:::

### Exercise 6

Naturally, the Mets experienced ups and downs during Ben's time with the team. Which seasons were best? To figure this out, we can simply sort the rows of the data frame.

```{r}
#| eval: false
arrange(mets_ben, _)
```

### Exercise 7

In 2006, the Mets had the best record in baseball during the regular season and nearly made the [*World Series*](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=World%20Series). How do these seasons rank in terms of the team's performance relative to our model?

```{r}
#| eval: false
mets_ben %>% 
  mutate(Diff = _) |>
  arrange(_)
```

### Exercise 8

Summarize the Mets performance

```{r}
#| eval: false
mets_ben |>
  summarize(
    num_years = _, 
    total_W = _, 
    total_L = _, 
    total_WPct = _, 
    sum_resid = _
  )
```

In these nine years, the Mets had a combined record of \_ wins and \_ losses, for an overall winning percentage of \_.

::: render-commit-push
This is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-1 repo on GitHub. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you've made, write an informative commit message (e.g., "Completed exercises 6 - 8"), and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.
:::

### Exercise 9

Next, let's look at the relationship between the price and width of Ikea furniture. Fill in the code below to visualize the relationship between the two variables using a scatterplot.

Then, use your visualization to describe the relationship between the width and price of Ikea furniture.

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = _____, aes(x = width, y = _____)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    x = "_____", 
    y = "_____", 
    title = "_____"
    )
```

### Exercise 10

Discretize the years into three chunks: one for each of the three general managers under whom Ben worked. [Jim Duquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Jim%20Duquette) was the Mets' [*general manager*](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=general%20manager) in 2004, [Omar Minaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Omar%20Minaya) from 2005 to 2010, and [Sandy Alderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Sandy%20Alderson) from 2011 to 2012.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mets_ben <- mets_ben %>% 
  mutate(
    gm = ifelse(
      yearID == _, 
      _, 
      ifelse(
        yearID >= _, 
        _, 
        _)
    )
  )

```

Alternatively, we use the `case_when` function

```{r}
#| eval: false
mets_ben <- mets_ben |>
  mutate(
    gm = case_when(
      yearID == _ ~ _, 
      yearID >= _ ~ _, 
      TRUE ~ _
    )
  )
```

::: render-commit-push
You're done and ready to submit your work! Render, commit, and push all remaining changes. You can use the commit message "Done with Lab 1!" , and make sure you have committed and pushed all changed files to GitHub (your Git pane in RStudio should be empty) and that **all** documents are updated in your repo on GitHub. The PDF document you submit to Gradescope should be identical to the one in your GitHub repo.
:::

### Exercise 11

Use the `gm` variable to define the manager groups with the `group_by()` operator, and run the summaries again, this time across the manager groups.

### Bonus

Do all the analysis at once, but retain the step-by-step logic.

## Submission

In this class, we'll be submitting PDF documents to Gradescope.

::: callout-warning
Before you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo. We will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.

Remember -- you must turn in a PDF file to the Gradescope page before the submission deadline for full credit.
:::
